I have created a responsive website containing my portfolio projects, a section about me, and a form box to contact me.

My webpage includes:

* Functional webpage

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Consistant Navbar on each page

* Navbar that contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages

* Working links

* Semantic html

* Valid and correct HTML

* Personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Properly utilized Bootstrap components and grid system
